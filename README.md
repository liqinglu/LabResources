The project is sourced from an activity

sometime, I need to maintain a lab resource spreadsheet maunally, so I think why not make it more easier to use, so I create this project, my purpose is everybody can browse/modify the lab resources what they want through a browser


Issues remain:
1. can't display chinese when chinese words was in html
2. response.py --> class HELLO --> GET --> can't handle exception scenario
